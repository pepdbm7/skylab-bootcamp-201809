# lesson 2 - Objects // 20 Exercises // Project: Skylab Airline.

In this lesson we will learn the beginnings in the persistence of the data, storing in objects, very different from arrays. We list your properties, we take out your values, we will treat them and store more data.

**to execute the files, you can do it in two ways:
open the index.html or with the Visual Studio Code debuger**
