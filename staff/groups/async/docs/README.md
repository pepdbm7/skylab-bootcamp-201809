## Technical description
-----
SkyTuts is a web application meant to run within a browser environment. It consists of a ReactJS frontend that connects to two APIs:
A User API that handles user registration and login and also stores user data,
and the Udacity public API, used to browse the platform's catalog.

The application is written in ReactJS and almost every component has been refactored using the PUG syntax for brevity and clarity.

The application's logic has been tested with the Mocha and Chai frameworks.
