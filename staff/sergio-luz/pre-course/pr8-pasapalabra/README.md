# Pasapalabra

A little project made with html, css and javascript

## General characteristics

The programm shows you the definition of a word and you will guess what word is.

The game will ask a question for each letter of the alphabet with a time limit of 130 seconds. For each question you will have 4 options:

1. To answer correctly the word and win a point.
2. To fail the word and no win points. 
3. To select "pasapalabra" to pass to the next letter. In that case you will have to answer again that letter, but the question will not be the same.

At the end of the game it will show you your points and the historical ranking of the players.

> At any time you can end the game, but you will not enter the ranking
