# Pasabalabra

## What does the program do

* This program is a simple simulation of the popular spanish tv game show: "Pasapalabra"

   * The program asks one trivia question for each letter of the alphabet and the user must answer each question. The answer starts or contains the said letter (if the answer contains the letter it will explicitally say so).
   The user has the option to pass on each question by saying: "Pasapalabra." The number of correct, incorrect, and passed questions are being kept track of.
   When the user finishes the alphabet of questions, it will go back and reask each question that was passed.
