# Bingo

## What does the program do?

* The program simulates a bingo game. When it executes it will ask for the name and will save it. It will also show a 15 number carton (excluding 0). The program will show a number and the user must confirm to pass on to the next turn, if the number shown is the same as one in the carton, it will change to a X, the carton will show at the end of each turn the changes. The program also asks the user if he/she wants to continue.

* When all the numbers in the same line the program will show a message "LINE!" but the program will keep on playing until all numbers have X.

* When the game finishes, it shows how many turns have passed. The program also asks if he/she wants to continue.
