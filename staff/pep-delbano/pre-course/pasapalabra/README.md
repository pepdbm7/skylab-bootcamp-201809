This game is based on the famous Spanish TV channel Antena 3, where the participants have to answer to a meaning said by the presenter with the word which sould have that meaning. The game has the instructions in first place, which we can unfold to see them complete, by clicking on the 3 dots. When we click on the OK button we change to a totally different window where we can see the alphabet, and once we push the button __START__ the countdown starts and we have __120 seconds__ to answer all the questions we can. The time can't be stopped unless we push the button __RESET__ to quit the game and go back to the instructions window. The questions we don't know the answer of can be skipped by clicking the button __PASAPALABRA__ or simply pushing the keyboard _Enter_ while the textfield is empty. If we write an answer for a word meaning, we can push the button __ACEPTAR__ or the keyboard _Enter_.  
  
The skipped questions will be kept for the next round, and so on till we answer them.  

When we have answered all of them or the time is expired, the results are shown in another new window and after clicking the ok button a new window where we are asked to introduce a nickname will appear. After introducing it and pushing Enter we have a new and last window withe the ranking of some random players and the nickname of the player who just have played. There is also an average rate of the players and a button __New Game__, which let us start over again and save the results under a nickname again, so we can save all the results on the ranking of every game we play.
