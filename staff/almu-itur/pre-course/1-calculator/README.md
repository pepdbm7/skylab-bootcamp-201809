#H1 CALCULATOR

**Calculator** requests the user to input two numbers and it returns the following operations calculated using both numbers:
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Note that in case that the user introduces only one number, **Calculator** returns only the square root of that number.

Once the operation phase is finished, **Calculator** will request the user whether he/she wants to continue calculating.

Indeterminations such as 0/0 are controlled and will return error.

*Note: The program keeps asking for numbers if the user introduces an invalid input.*
