#H1 PASAPALABRA HTML

**Pasapalabra HTML** works as the famous TV show:

1. A letter or a word containing a letter will be proposed to the user.
2. A definition will be displayed
3. The user will need to write the correct word for the definition given using the letter proposed on step 1. The user can:
    + Click on the "SEND" button to send his answer.
    + Click on "PASAPALABRA" to jump to the next letter.
    + Click on "END" to finish the game. 
4. If the answer is correct, the user scores.
5. When the whole alphabet has been used, the remaining letters (not correct, nor incorrect but jumped) will prompt again for the user to reply.

The game ends either when the user click on the "END" button or when the coundown reaches 0.

On END, **Pasapalabra HTML** will:

1. Show the user's results
2. Show the ranking of the game
3. Display two buttons:
    + VOLVER A JUGAR: game restarts
    + EXIT: the game ends, screen is cleared

*Note: invalid inputs during the game are interpreted as errors*
*Note 2: there are no distinctions between lowercase and uppercase, all inputs are valid*
