#H1 SKYLAB AIRLINES

**Skylab Airlines** works with an array of 10 flights and

First, **Skylab Airlines** requests the user to give his/her name.

Then, the user can:

1. See the flights amicably.
2. See the average cost of flights
3. See which flights are not direct
4. Shows the destination of the last 5 flights of the day

Once the results are shown, **Skylab Airlines** asks the user whether he/she is a USER or an ADMIN. The user needs to write either ADMIN or USER and press INTRO.

USER
=====
USER can choose to see flights based on the price:
1. ALTO + INTRO: to see flights more expensive than a given price
2. BAJO + INTRO: to see flights less expensive than a given price
3. IGUAL + INTRO: to see flights with the same price as a given price

After selecting an option, **Skylab Airlines** will request a price and then will show the results based on the user choice.

ADMIN
=====
ADMIN can choose one of the following options by pressing 1, 2, or 3 and then INTRO:
1. Create flights
2. Delete flights
3. Exit

*Note: 'Exit' asks the user/admin to confirm his/her choice with a Y/N and pressing INTRO.*
*Note 2: User errors or invalid inputs are controlled by **Skylab Airlines** and the programm will stay paused until the user inserts a valid option.*
