#H1 PASAPALABRA 

**Pasapalabra** works as the famous TV show:

1. A letter or a word containing a letter will be proposed to the user.
2. A definition will be displayed
3. The user will need to write the correct word for the definition given using the letter proposed on step 1. The user can either answers or use the command "pasapalabra" to jump to the next letter.
4. If it is correct, the user scores.
5. When the whole alphabet has been used, the remaining letters (not correct, nor incorrect but jumped) will prompt again for the user to reply.

The game ends when the user types "END". 

On END, **Pasapalabra** will:

1. Show the user's results
2. Show the ranking of the game
3. Ask the user if he wants to play again.

*Note: invalid inputs during the game are interpreted as errors*
*Note 2: there are no distinctions between lowercase and uppercase, all inputs are valid*
