When the program starts, it will ask for the name of the player.
During the first turn a cardboard with 15 numbers will be shown (excluding the 0 always), to pass to the next shift the user must confirm by confirming () displaying another number, if it coincides with any of the existing ones in the cardboard, it will change for a " X "or a 0.
The cardboard will be shown, at the end of each shift, with the changes made, indicating to the user what number has been found.
The program will ask the user at the start of each shift if they wish to continue, if it continues, it will follow the same pattern as before.

Of course, when all the numbers of the same line are in "X", it will show a message "LINEA!", But the execution will continue, the game will only end when all the numbers are "X".

When the game is over, it will tell the user how many turns the cardboard has been completed. Finally, you should ask if you want to play again.

* When the letter is shown, the user will be asked if he really wants that card or generate another one, if he really wants that card, he will have to answer "yes" to proceed

* Establish a point system, the more shifts the cardboard is completed, the fewer points (the points system integrates as you want), on the contrary, less turns, more points.

* Before starting the game, show the point system to the user.
