# SKYLAB BINGO
A very modest script which displays through a _window.alert_ a series of random numbers as if it were a bingo carton.
The program then displays a random ball in turns and if the ball matches one of the numbers in the carton, the matching number is crossed out with an asterisk.
When the numbers are all crossed out, the script displays an alert with the word "BINGO!" and the number of turns it took to fill the bingo carton.

## HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM
Simply open the _index.html_ file and open a console in Chrome or Firefox by pressing the **F12 key**.
